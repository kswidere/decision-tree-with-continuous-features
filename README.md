Decision tree implementation for continuous attributes. Comparison of methods of determining the number and locations of divisions of a continuous space in tests.
We will investigate the qualities of 3 discretisation methods for a given number of intervals (equidistant, equidistant and k-means methods)
and compare them with methods based on the evaluation of the best split location for continuous values of a given attribute during the learning process of decision trees
decision-making (gini impurity and information gain methods).
Tests will be performed for two datasets: binary and multi-class classification.
